# Mean_and_StdDev

Asignment 5 of CS341 Software Engineering

Specific Requirements
The program should receive a sample of real numbers from a text file and report the mean and standard deviation of the sample. 
Begin by analyzing the problem and then develop a design plan for your program.

Overview of the Asignment
1. Write a GUI Java application to read a set of real numbers from an input file. 
2. Analyze your needs and implement your own LinkedList class to store these numbers.
3. Calculate and display the mean and standard deviation of the of this set of real numbers.  
4. Use JFileChooser to allow the user to select the file of their choice in a GUI manner.  
  You can do this by using WindowBuilder to add a button. 
  Add code that opens a JFileChooser when the button is pressed. 
  Research JFileChooser to see how to go about writing this code.
5. Test your application

Program Features
1.	During input, numbers should be stored internally with a linked list. 
2.	You will need to implement your own linked list.
3.	The numbers input into this program will be stored in an external text file - one number per line.
4.	After performing the calculations, the program should output the results clearly and concisely in a GUI text component.
5.	You must use the Java programming language to develop this program.

Testing
1.	Test for invalid input, such as "3b4" 
2.	Test for an empty file as input
3.	Test an input file with one line only
4.	Test with a file containing empty lines in the middle.
